The science: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm

The theory:

We all have varying attention spans ... for me i believe ur attention span is ur age in mins so a 7 year old can only concentrate for 7min at a go.. anything beyond that, the child needs to take a walk.
This app hooks up with ur web browser.. you get to set a duration say 50min... and ur whole mind is focused on doing just one thing.
The idea is if u have not done what u have to do within that time get up and try again, don't force it....


The benefits:
Manage your time 
Expand your capacity
Maximize the minutes
Work at an healthy pace
Conserve energy
