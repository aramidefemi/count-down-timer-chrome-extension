The thoery:
- It's simple .. we all have varying attention spans ... for me i believe ur attention span is ur age in mins so a 7 year old can only concentrate for 7min at a go.. anything beyond that, the child needs to take a walk. 
- This app hooks up with ur web browser.. you get to set a duration say 50min... and ur whole mind is focused on doing just one thing.
- The idea is if u have not done what u have to do within that time get up andd try again, dont force it....

The benefits:
Manage your time 
Expand your capacity
Maximize the minutes
Work at an healthy pace
Conserve energy
